# Template Email for Followup with Policy Analyst(s)

**Subject:** Request for additional information on `[policy issue]`  

Dear `[Name of Policy Analyst(s)]`,

I am contacting you to request information on your organization’s perspective on `[policy issue]`. I am a `[research assistant/student/postdoc/other position]` at the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences ([BITSS](bitss.org/)). As part of its Open Policy Analysis initiative, BITSS is developing a database of policy analyses and stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of evaluating the transparency and reproducibility of these analyses and identifying potential improvements for transparency and reproducibility.

From our review of your organization's policy analysis `[Title of Policy Analysis]` we see that the main benefits (`bullet points #1, #2 etc`) and costs (`bullet points #3, #4 etc`) are: 

  * `[benefit 1]`
  * `[benefit 2]`
  * `[benefits ....]`
  * `[costs 1]`
  * `[costs 2]`
  * `[costs ....]` 

    * Are these correct? If not, could you provide a one sentence description for each correct figure? 
    * **If policy estimate is vague, e.g. "thousands of dollars":** Could you please provide the precise quantities used by your organization for these costs and benefits?

Thank you in advance for your response and please let me know if you have any questions.

Best Regards,  
`[Name]`
