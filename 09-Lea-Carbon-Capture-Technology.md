## Policy estimates


## Presented by supporting group
**Evidence of supporters citing this report:**
Mentions IPCC report.
https://www.climatedocket.com/2019/03/13/carbon-capture-fossil-fuels-ciel-report/

**Title of report:**
Global Warming of 1.5C, Section 2.4 "Disentangling the Whole System Transformation," subsection 2.4.2.3 "Deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage."

**Authoring Organization:**
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

**Authors (if any):**
Rogelj, J., D. Shindell, K. Jiang, S. Fifita, P. Forster, V. Ginzburg, C. Handa, H. Kheshgi, S. Kobayashi, E. Kriegler, L. Mundaca, R. Séférian, and M.V. Vilariño, 2018

**URL of report:**

### Main Benefits
###### - potential for capturing and storing 2,000 gigatons of carbon dioxide by 2050, world-wide.

### Main Costs

IPCC had no mention of monetary costs (too broad on global scale), but found D.O.E. document: https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/10/f67/Internal%20Revenue%20Code%20Tax%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf

##### Overall:
- Monetary: (for the United States)
 - \45Q tax credit\ (for businesses producing C02)
  - $50 per metric ton stored geologically
  - $35 for EOR, EGR, or CO2 utilized in another qualified manner, with the credit increasing annually until the full value is reached in 2026.
- Not fully-proven technology
- Risks of further environmental damage in storage process (leakage)
- Vulnerable communities negatively affected

Fossil Fuels and Accelerate the Climate Crisis

#### Main Benefits

- In the race to mitigate the effects of climate change and keep global warming to the maximum increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, any technology, such as Carbon-Capture technology that limits or reduces the amount of Carbon Dioxide in earth's atmosphere is helpful; what matters is who is funding it, supporting it, and why.

#### Main Costs
- Specific monetary costs not mentioned.
- Cost to environment from: Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)
  - Most large-scale CCS projects use captured carbon
for *Enhanced Oil Recovery*;
  - *potential for 40% more coal and up to 923 million additional barrels of oil in the US alone by 2040*
 - Calculation of Gigatons of Carbon Dioxide released into atmosphere SOLELY from CCUS technology in the United States alone:
       - According to the EPA's "Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator":
       - 5.80 mmbtu/barrel × 20.31 kg C/mmbtu × 44 kg CO2/12 kg C × 1 metric ton/1,000 kg = 0.43 metric tons CO2/barrel
       - "923 million additional barrels of oil" in US (CIEL) = 923,000,000 [barrels] x 0.43 [tons of CO2/barrel]
        - = 396890000 (~ 396 million) more tons of C02 emitted by 2040 in the US alone
  - 0.39689 Gigatons C02 added by 2040 in US alone.  396 million/20 years = approximately 20 million tons of additional C02 added by the United States to the atmosphere per year from CCUS for EOR
- CCS preserves existing energy and transportation systems with high social costs to society.
- Requirement of abundance of energy for CCS leads to potential environmental externalities
- Not proven to work on a mass scale
