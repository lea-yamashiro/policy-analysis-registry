## Section Eight


The housing choice voucher program (section 8)  is the largest US housing program funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that provides rent subsidy to low-income families. Proponents argue that section 8 should be funded more by the government while opponents argue that this program is flawed, and fails to attract private housing providers.

#### Main Benefits

- Seventy-one percent (7.8 million) of the nation’s 11 million extremely low-income renter households are severely housing cost-burdened, spending more than half of their incomes on rent and utilities. Section 8 benefits can alleviate this pressure on low-income households. 

- Funding the program is necessary because it can benefit the following populations: 

Amongst eligible applicants, only one out of four receive the housing assistance voucher. 
 For every 100 extremely low-income renters, only 37 affordable housing is available. 

- Housing vouchers reduced homelessness and housing instability by 75% among TANF-eligible families with children (National Housing Conference). 


#### Main Costs

- It costs $640 billion over ten years to expand the program. This budget will come from raising taxes on corporations and large financial institutions. 

- the new constructions will cost $300 billion which is gained paid by instituting a financial fee on certain liabilities of firms with over $50 billion in assets.

#### Main Benefits
- The Project-Based Rental Assistance programs provide homes for nearly 2.2 million families and elderly households in privately owned housing(2016). 
- The total number of individuals who benefit from this program is 5,350,188.
-The Urban Institute estimates that 22 million households are eligible for housing assistance but only 21% receive it. Funding more can help solve this problem.(2016) 

#### Main Costs
 -The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allocates more than $22 billion each year to local housing agencies (2016).

- Section 8 participants have difficulty finding a place to stay, and finding a landlord who can accept them. It’s tough for the recipients to find a landlord that is willing to accept the voucher.  
The average family gets stuck on a wait-list for a year and a half, but many exceed seven years. 

- A 2018 Urban Institute study found that landlords nationwide often refuse to accept vouchers. In Fort Worth, 78% of landlords contacted by the Urban Institute wouldn’t take vouchers. In Los Angeles, it was 76%; in Philadelphia, 67%.

- 40 percent of the voucher funds in Cook County, and $1 billion nationally, went unused because voucher holders couldn't find landlords willing to accept their scrip. 

- In some markets, the payment standards are inflated and may not accurately reflect rents in submarkets. This variation causes coucher holders to cluster in lower-cost areas where vouchers are more lucrative for landlords. One case study of Milwaukee, Wisconsin suggests that voucher holders paid slightly more in rent than unassisted renters for comparable units, at a total annual cost to the government of approximately $3.8 million. 

- Using data from the 2015 Rental Housing Finance Survey and the Internal Revenue Service’s Statistics of Income Division, HUD estimates that the United States has 10 to 12 million total landlords and only a fraction of them participate in the HCV program. 

- HUD reports that between 2009 and 2016, the number of unique landlords participating in the HCV program declined from 775,000 to 695,000.
