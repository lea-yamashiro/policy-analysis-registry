## Free College

This policy aims to guarantee the right to a free public education for all American citizens at the collegiate level. This means wiping student debt and paying for tuition through a subsidy granted by the "Robinhood Tax", or through a financial transaction tax. The main opposers of this policy argue that this tax will be an added sales tax for retirees and the business industry.

## Policy estimates


### Presented by supporting group
**Evidence of supporters citing this report:**
https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/

**Title of report:** The Revenue Potential of a Financial Transaction Tax for U.S. Financial Markets

**Authoring Organization:** Political Economy Research Institute (PERI)

**Authors (if any):** Robert Pollin, James Heintz, and Thomas Herndon

**URL of report:**
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02692171.2018.1485634

#### Main Benefits
- The tax would fully subsidize the "Free College" plan for free tuition and wiping student debt (FTT would generate about $250 bn per year)

#### Main Costs
- The Inclusive Prosperity act (Tax on the sale of stocks, bonds and derivatives. The tax imposed will be 0.5 percent on stocks, 0.1 percent on bonds, and 0.005 percent on derivatives or other investments) would result in:
  - A tax credit provision that would result in foregone revenue of $20 bn
  - A net change in tax revenues would result in foregone revenue of $10 bn

### Report 2

**Title of report:** -

**Authoring Organization:** Unaffiliated Authors

**Authors (if any):** Raphaël Charron-Chénier, Thomas Shapiro, Louise Seamster, Laura Sullivan

**URL of report:**
https://elizabethwarren.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Experts-Letter-to-Senator-Warren-.pdf

#### Main Benefits
- Total loan forgiveness for up to 76.2% of households with student debt
- Households at the bottom and middle three income quintiles would experience substantially higher rates of student debt forgiveness (80% or more across these groups) compared with households in the top income quintile (less than 50%)

#### Main Costs
- The cost of the Warren's debt-specific policy is estimated to be $640 billion (it's noted that economic growth generated by proposal will likely reduce it's overall cost)


#### Follow Up
Received a reply from Louise Seamster on first e-mail but none thereafter


### Presented by opposing group
**Evidence of opponents (U.S. Chamber of Commerce) citing this report:**
https://thehill.com/policy/finance/461579-chamber-of-commerce-argues-against-financial-transaction-taxes

**Title of report:** Financial Transaction Taxes: A tax on investors, taxpayers, and consumers

**Authoring Organization:** Center for Capital Markets

**Authors (if any):** James J. Angel

**URL of report:** https://www.centerforcapitalmarkets.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/CCMC_FTT-Report_v2-DIGITAL.pdf

#### Main Benefits
- No benefits assessed

#### Main Costs
- FTT will drive up cost of trading by more than amount of tax ($100 stock would cost 50$ directly and more indirectly, a tenfold increase)
- Retirement savings will stay put if FTT isn't enacted (Retirement investors will end up with 8.5% less in 401ks, or $20,000 on average)

### Report 2 (Unofficial Report)
**Evidence of opponents citing this report:**
Both economists wrote report themselves

**Title of report:** Pricing "Free College"

**Authoring Organization:** Urban Institute

**Authors (if any):** Sandy Baum, Alexandra Tilsey

**URL of report:** https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/pricing-free-college

#### Main Benefits
- None assessed

#### Main Costs
- Since low income students pay less in grant aid, this policy would increase inequality by giving (on average) $2870 to high-income families and $580 to low-income families

- Overall, more than a third of the benefits of free college would go to high-income households (earning more than $120,000)
